## Logical Overview 

![A Logical Overview of the Harmonostatics Package](images/logical_overview.png)

## Installation

You can install the development version of harmonostatics from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("homeymusic/harmonostatics")
```

## Examples

The [tests](https://github.com/homeymusic/harmonostatics/tree/main/tests/testthat) include additional examples.
