## Installation

You can install the development version of harmonostatics from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("homeymusic/harmonostatics")
```

## Examples

```{r library}
library(harmonostatics)
```

```{r major_third}
harmony(x=4,home=0,name="Major Third")
```

```{r c_major}
harmony(c(0,4,7),0,"C Major")
```

```{r ionian}
harmony(c(0,2,4,5,7,9,11,12),0,"Major Scale | Ionian Mode")
```

```{r chromatic}
harmony(0:12,0,"Chromatic Scale")
```

```{r potential_energy_I}
potential_energy(c(0,4,7),c(0,4,7),0,"I Ionian - 1st Scale Degree")
```

```{r potential_energy_IV}
