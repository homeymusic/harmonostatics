\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

The Introduction section, of referenced text \cite{bib1} expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable). The introduction should not include subheadings.

Springer Nature does not impose a strict layout as standard however authors are advised to check the individual requirements for the journal they are planning to submit to as there may be journal-level preferences. When preparing your text please also be aware that some stylistic choices are not supported in full text XML (publication version), including coloured font. These will not be replicated in the typeset article if it is accepted. 


\section{Words}\label{sec2}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The interaction of musical pitches can be described with the help of the concept of a field of force. Namely, instead of saying that one pitch acts on another, we may say that the pitch creates a field around itself; a certain force then acts on every other pitch located in this field.
\item Consonance and brilliance are not different phenomena but two aspects of the same thing.
\item Brilliance is the musical property of a pitch that causes it to experience a force when placed in a harmonic field. Brilliance can be major or minor. Like pitches attract each other and unlike pitches repel each other. An object with an absence of brilliance is referred to as neutral.
\item from Nature: Theoretical physics is the development of mathematical formalisms and computational protocols for describing all aspects of objects found in the world around us and their interaction. This can involve both providing models for understanding empirical results or constructing self-logical theories for explain phenomena beyond current experiments. https://www.nature.com/subjects/theoretical-physics
\item adjust this from bowl18 to point out that studies have focused only on the tonic: Previous evaluations have focused on the two-tone combinations (“dyads”) that define the chromatic scale, a set of 12 tones over an octave used in much music worldwide (Table S1). Studies of dyadic consonance have been repeated many times over the last century and, despite some variation in consonance ranking, listeners broadly agree on the dyads heard as the most and least attractive (12, 32). Surprisingly, comparable perceptual data are not available for more complex tone combinations, such as triads (three-tone chords) and tetrads (four-tone chords).

Equations in \LaTeX\ can either be inline or on-a-line by itself (``display equations''). For
inline equations use the \verb+$...$+ commands. E.g.: The equation
$H\psi = E \psi$ is written via the command \verb+$H \psi = E \psi$+.

\begin{align}
D_\mu &=  \partial_\mu - ig \frac{\lambda^a}{2} A^a_\mu \nonumber \\
F^a_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^a_\nu \label{eq2}
\end{align}
Notice the use of \verb+\nonumber+ in the align environment at the end
of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on
lines where no equation numbers are required. The \verb+\label{}+ command
should only be used at the last line of an align environment where
\verb+\nonumber+ is not used.
\begin{equation}
Y_\infty = \left( \frac{m}{\textrm{GeV}} \right)^{-3}
    \left[ 1 + \frac{3 \ln(m/\textrm{GeV})}{15}
    + \frac{\ln(c_2/5)}{15} \right]
\end{equation}
The class file also supports the use of \verb+\mathbb{}+, \verb+\mathscr{}+ and
\verb+\mathcal{}+ commands. As such \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathscr{R}+
and \verb+\mathcal{R}+ produces $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathscr{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}$
respectively (refer Subsubsection~\ref{subsubsec2}).

\section{Tables}\label{sec5}

Tables can be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment. To put
footnotes inside tables you should use \verb+\footnotetext[]{...}+ tag.
The footnote appears just below the table itself (refer Tables~\ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}). 
For the corresponding footnotemark use \verb+\footnotemark[...]+

In case of double column layout, tables which do not fit in single column width should be set to full text width. For this, you need to use \verb+\begin{table*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table*}+ instead of \verb+\begin{table}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table}+ environment. Lengthy tables which do not fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table. For this, you need to use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable}+ instead of \verb+\begin{table*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table*}+ environment. This environment puts tables rotated to single column width. For tables rotated to double column width, use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable*}+.

\section{Figures}\label{sec6}

As per the \LaTeX\ standards you need to use eps images for \LaTeX\ compilation and \verb+pdf/jpg/png+ images for \verb+PDFLaTeX+ compilation. This is one of the major difference between \LaTeX\ and \verb+PDFLaTeX+. Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector image file. Avoid using subfigures. The command for inserting images for \LaTeX\ and \verb+PDFLaTeX+ can be generalized. The package used to insert images in \verb+LaTeX/PDFLaTeX+ is the graphicx package. Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in the below example:

In case of double column layout, the above format puts figure captions/images to single column width. To get spanned images, we need to provide \verb+\begin{figure*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{figure*}+.

For sample purpose, we have included the width of images in the optional argument of \verb+\includegraphics+ tag. Please ignore this. 

\section{Algorithms, Program codes and Listings}\label{sec7}

Packages \verb+algorithm+, \verb+algorithmicx+ and \verb+algpseudocode+ are used for setting algorithms in \LaTeX\ using the format:

%%=============================================%%
%% For presentation purpose, we have included  %%
%% \bigskip command. please ignore this.       %%
%%=============================================%%
\bigskip
\begin{verbatim}

You may refer above listed package documentations for more details before setting \verb+algorithm+ environment. For program codes, the ``program'' package is required and the command to be used is \verb+\begin{program}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{program}+. A fast exponentiation procedure:

\begin{program}
\BEGIN \\ %
  \FOR i:=1 \TO 10 \STEP 1 \DO
     |expt|(2,i); \\ |newline|() \OD %
\rcomment{Comments will be set flush to the right margin}
\WHERE
\PROC |expt|(x,n) \BODY
          z:=1;
          \DO \IF n=0 \THEN \EXIT \FI;
             \DO \IF |odd|(n) \THEN \EXIT \FI;
\COMMENT{This is a comment statement};
                n:=n/2; x:=x*x \OD;
             \{ n>0 \};
             n:=n-1; z:=z*x \OD;
          |print|(z) \ENDPROC
\END
\end{program}


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Calculate $y = x^n$}\label{algo1}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require $n \geq 0 \vee x \neq 0$
\Ensure $y = x^n$ 
\State $y \Leftarrow 1$
\If{$n < 0$}\label{algln2}
        \State $X \Leftarrow 1 / x$
        \State $N \Leftarrow -n$
\Else
        \State $X \Leftarrow x$
        \State $N \Leftarrow n$

        \If{$N$ is even}
            \State $X \Leftarrow X \times X$
            \State $N \Leftarrow N / 2$
        \Else[$N$ is odd]
            \State $y \Leftarrow y \times X$
            \State $N \Leftarrow N - 1$
        \EndIf
\EndWhile

\section{Cross referencing}\label{sec8}

Environments such as figure, table, equation and align can have a label
declared via the \verb+\label{#label}+ command. For figures and table
environments use the \verb+\label{}+ command inside or just
below the \verb+\caption{}+ command. You can then use the
\verb+\ref{#label}+ command to cross-reference them. As an example, consider
the label declared for Figure~\ref{fig1} which is
\verb+\label{fig1}+. To cross-reference it, use the command 
\verb+Figure \ref{fig1}+, for which it comes up as
``Figure~\ref{fig1}''. 

To reference line numbers in an algorithm, consider the label declared for the line number 2 of Algorithm~\ref{algo1} is \verb+\label{algln2}+. To cross-reference it, use the command \verb+\ref{algln2}+ for which it comes up as line~\ref{algln2} of Algorithm~\ref{algo1}.

\subsection{Details on reference citations}\label{subsec7}

Standard \LaTeX\ permits only numerical citations. To support both numerical and author-year citations this template uses \verb+natbib+ \LaTeX\ package. For style guidance please refer to the template user manual.

Here is an example for \verb+\cite{...}+: \cite{bib1}. Another example for \verb+\citep{...}+: \citep{bib2}. For author-year citation mode, \verb+\cite{...}+ prints Jones et al. (1990) and \verb+\citep{...}+ prints (Jones et al., 1990).

All cited bib entries are printed at the end of this article: \cite{bib3}, \cite{bib4}, \cite{bib5}, \cite{bib6}, \cite{bib7}, \cite{bib8}, \cite{bib9}, \cite{bib10}, \cite{bib11} and \cite{bib12}.

\section{Examples for theorem like environments}\label{sec10}

For theorem like environments, we require \verb+amsthm+ package. There are three types of predefined theorem styles exists---\verb+thmstyleone+, \verb+thmstyletwo+ and \verb+thmstylethree+

\section{Methods}\label{sec11}

Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work. Authors are encouraged to include RIIDs where appropriate. 

\textbf{Ethical approval declarations} (only required where applicable) Any article reporting experiment/s carried out on (i)~live vertebrate (or higher invertebrates), (ii)~humans or (iii)~human samples must include an unambiguous statement within the methods section that meets the following requirements: 

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Approval: a statement which confirms that all experimental protocols were approved by a named institutional and/or licensing committee. Please identify the approving body in the methods section

\item Accordance: a statement explicitly saying that the methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations

\item Informed consent (for experiments involving humans or human tissue samples): include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardian/s
\end{enumerate}

If your manuscript includes potentially identifying patient/participant information, or if it describes human transplantation research, or if it reports results of a clinical trial then  additional information will be required. Please visit (\url{https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies}) for Nature Portfolio journals, (\url{https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/publishing-ethics/14214}) for Springer Nature journals, or (\url{https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies\#ethics+and+consent}) for BMC.

\section{Western Tradition}\label{sec12}

\begin{enumerate}
\item nearest neighbor symmetry versus tonic-octave symmetry around the 2nds, 3rds, 6ths and 7ths (is there a curve on the plot?)
\end{enumerate}
\section{Emergence of Diatonic}\label{diatonicSec}
\begin{enumerate}
\item tonic bias pleasantness gives ionian and mixolydian
\item octave bias pleasantness gives phrygian and aeolian
\item tonic-octave consonance gives dorian
\item tonic-octave brilliance gives lydian and locrian
\end{enumerate}
\section{Locrian the Sublime}\label{locrianSec}
A composer of the Western, tonic (and therefore major) biased tradition, when confronted with Locrian mode, will ask, ``Where's the Perfect Fifth? Where's the Major 7th? Without the perfect 5th how will my chords will be consonant and my cadences strong?'' If the composer were to frame those questions in a slightly different way the sense of doom would disappear. How?

\begin{figure}[h]%
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig.eps}
\caption{Locrian mode with no perfecet fifth and no major seventh.}\label{locrianScaleMusic}
\end{figure}

We know from equation the consonance is the same when regardless of the ordering of the numerator and denominator of the frequency ratio. We also know from equation that the potential energy of cadences is a function of the abolsute value of the distance between the notes.

If the composer were to reframe the questions as, ``Where's the 3:2 or 2:3 interval? Where's the +-8 interval?'' then he would see that the Locrian mode is a fully capable and arguably the most sublime of all the modes for composition.

Include sheet music for Bach in Locrian.

Introduce the image of the piano with the mirror. With a mirror placed to the left of the home note then - with one exception, whatever the pianist plays, the mirror image pianist is playing the same piece perfectly well in the reflected mode: Ionian-Phrygian, Mixolydian-Aeolian and Lydian-Locrian. The exception is Dorian. For Dorian mode, we must place the mirror directly in the center of the tritone.

Now show Bach's piece in all modes with sheet music first and then including piano roll.

\section{Number Theory}\label{sec12}
\begin{enumerate}
\item consonance 1,3,6,10,15 are triangular numbers, other than 7 which is extremely brilliant
\item Pythagoras tetraktys of the decad (cite: James Tenney History of Consonance and Dissonance p. 12)
\item maybe point out that the reason major-mior emerges is that all the major-minor mirrors are exactly 2 apart? 
\end{enumerate}
\section{General Solutions}\label{sec12}


\begin{enumerate}
  
\item Additional Octaves
\item Higher Prime Limits / Larger Range of Just Intontation Microtunings in One Octave
\item Frequency-based $\phi$
\item $\eta$ variations ... what does this mean? related to freq approach?
\item $\rho>0$ presence of other pitches
\item where's magnetism? does that come with harmonodynamics?
\end{enumerate}


\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Many powerful music-theoretic ideas emerge from a tonic-bias model of musical harmony: pitch classes, chord inversions, the circle of fifths.

Yet a concept that does not formally emerge (but is informally known) is model for brilliance (brightness: major versus minor).

In our theory, any test pitch (with the exception of the tritone) that is introduced into the tonic-octave pitch field must take on a major-minor value.
