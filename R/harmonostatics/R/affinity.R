# Estimate Disaffinity of the ET Tritone
#
# We use the ET tritone which has a ratio of √2:1 with the tonic
# and 1:√2 with the octave
# Because √2 is not a positive integer we can't use prime factors to determine
# affinity. So for the tritone values we let symmetry and existing experimental
# data on consonance guide us.
#
# the lesser septimal tritone 7:5 is -17.5 cents from 600 and
# the greater septimal tritone 10:7 is +17.5 cents from 600
# we see this same reflection symmetry in all the other just intonation intervals
# for example:
# the Major 3rd is -13.7 cents from 400
# the minor 6th is +13.7 cents from 800
# the mean of the two septimal tritones ratios
# 7/5 = 1.400000
# 10/7 = 1.428571
# is 1.414286
# which is -7.215191e-05 from the sqrt(2)
# our assumption is that this small difference is beyond
# human detection in the context of musical harmony,
#
# For the affinity value, we take a small leap of intuition and use the mean of
# the affinities for the lesser septimal tritone and greater septimal tritones
