# level 0 is the primary group of 13 semitones from tonic to octave
# we use the word level instead of octave throughout
# due to the name space collision between
# * octave as in the interval name
# * octave as in the group of 13 semitones (level)

# Directional Derivative:
# rotate around the origin by the rotation angle
# changing the coordinate system
# from: octave-affinity versus tonic-affinity
# to: octave-tonic-affinity versus brightness-polarity
